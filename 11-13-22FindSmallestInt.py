# Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.

# For example:

# Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
# Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
# You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.

def find_smallest_int(arr):
    return min(arr)

# p- array of numbers
# r-  one number
# e - 
# p - just use min() so much more easier then JS
